# ChoreBot
A post-chore services platform to bring those who need extra cash and those who need stuff done on one easy to use platform

# A basic outline for scheduling post-chore services:

User registration and login: Users can create an account and log in to the app. They can input their home address and other details.

Service request: Users can request post-chore services and specify their location.

Payment confirmation: Before a chore is assigned, the app will check that the user has confirmed payment.

Chore assignment: Based on the user's location, the app will assign the chore to the nearest available service provider within a 10 km radius.

Service completion: The service provider will complete the chore and mark it as done on the app.

Payment processing: After the chore is completed, the app will process payment to the service provider.
